# ItemAuthorize
Minecraft plugin that allows you to authorize items. Useful for ingame currencies.

# Usage
Simply hold an item in your main hand and execute the command: 
`/authorize` or `/auth`

This will append lore to the targetted item. The lore states the authorizor's username, the date, and the time of authorization.

In addition, the authorization will be logged to the console for an administrator to view if necessary.

Without this plugin, lore cannot be reproduced in survival minecraft without the use of administrator commands. This makes lore very effective in ensuring that ingame currencies are genuine and approved.
